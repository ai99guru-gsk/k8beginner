Overview of Kubernetes 
- What is Kubernetes 
	- From Google, released to CNCF (cloud native computing foundation) and became defacto standard for container archtestration 
	- Def : "Kubernetes is an open-source container(*) orchestration(*) system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management"
		- Understand containers
		- Understand orchestration
- What kunernetes is NOT
	- will revisit later
	
	
Containers- 
	- Why do we need containers?
		- compatibility issue (matrix of hell)
		- long setup time
		- difference in dev, test and prod env
		
	- 2 objectives 
		- remove dependency on OS and hardware
		- remove compatibility dependency of tenants 

	- def: Isolated environement with it's own 
		- processes 
		- network
		- services
		- mounts 
	   but dependent on OS Kernel 	
 
How containers works-
 	- Understand how different flavours of OS (redhat, ubuntu, centos etc) work
 		- Linux kernel manages the hardware
 		- the distros use same kernel but pack different softwares / tools on top of kernel 
 			- drivers 
 			- filemanagers
 			- GUI
 			- dev tools 
 			- compilers etc 
 	- containers can run any "guest OS" based container on top of "host OS" provided it is same kernel 
 		- e.g. can run image of centos on ubuntu os 
 		- you can't run windows OS based container on linux kernel 
 	- containers purpose if not to run another kernel on other kernel e.g. run linux on windows machine
 		- for this use virtualization tools like hypervisor (e.g. virtual box)
 		
Containers vs Virtual Machine-
	- virtual machines : hardware -> host OS -> hypervisor -> guest os1 -> your taste
											 -> guest os2 -> your taste
											 
	- containers: hardware -> host OS -> container runtime -> container1 (trimmed os layer + dependecies + libraries + applicaion)
											 -> container2 (trimmed os layer + dependecies + libraries + applicaion)	  
 		
	- VMs are 
		- bulky, high on resource utilization like CPU, storage etc.
		- need full OS e.g. Ubuntu desktop ISO is 4+ Gi
		- full OS is booted
		- NOT dependent on host kernel i.e. you can run linux on windows OS
	
	- Containers are 
		- lightweight on resources 
		- use layers technology, so the images are in MBs
			- if you have say ubuntu image and next container image is built on it, same image is not downloaded again 
		- boots fast 
		- dependent on host kernel, so can't have windows container on linux host
		
Modern scenario 
	- most of the s/w are now containerized and stored in registry
		- you just need to know the image name and tag
	- examples
		- docker run nginx
		- docker run postgres
		- docker run postgres 
		- docker run mssql
		- docker run nodejs
		- docker run mongodb
	- if you need to scale, just create one more container (completely isolated running instance of the image)
		- image is not downloaded again 
	- if a container is failed, simply destroy it and create new one
	- app developers containerize the applications 
		- create Dockerfile on top of existing images like nodejs
		- all libraries and dependencies are taken care of in Dockerfile
	- ops team can run the container 
		- need not worry about dependencies, libraries, conflicts etc. 
	
Container Orchestration
	- You have containerized the application and happily running it in PROD
	- how do you scale it - up and down 
	- how to manage communication / networking across your container, database container, cache container like redis. message queue container etc
	
	- def: Automatically deploy and manage containers is orchestration
		- not one or two but 100s and 1000s of containers 
		
	- options 
		- docker swarm
			- easy to start 
			- doesn't support complex scenarios   
		- kunernetes
			- little difficult to start
			- backed by Google and huge community 
			- huge 3rd party support 
		- Apache Mesos 
			- Complicated 
			- can manage high complex scenarios 

What is Kubernetes -
	- def: "open source container orchestration technology to deploy and manage 100s of 1000s of containers in clustered environement"   

Advantages of Kubernetes-
	- Highly available (by design) 
		- can scale massively 
		- can auto heal
	- Load balances across containers 
	- If harware becomes contraints, bring up new nodes 
	- all is done declaratively 
		- you just say what is needed 
		- K8S get it done

What Kubernetes is NOT-
